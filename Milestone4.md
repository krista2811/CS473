# Milestone 4: High-fi prototype

## 1. Project Summary

- Many CS students want to get information on personal coursework, but asking, getting, and sharing diverse experiences (or opinion) is not easy.

- We propose DragCS, which provides an opportunity for asking, recommending coursework, and sharing experiences and opinions for the specific personal needs.

- This is unique in that it leverages crowds’ knowledge to offer a better-customized solution. 
  - Compared to OTL, recommendations are more customized (because they are made for one person), seamless (because one makes recommendations for all semesters) and made in a longer-term (i.e., multiple vs. one semester)



## 2. Instruction
Welcome to DragCS! In DragCS, you can ask customized coursework for you as well as answer and vote to questions. 

### Step 1
Let's look at the main page. You can take a look at questions waiting for you, ask your own question, or search for the existing questions. 

First, let's ask a question. Press + buttons on the main page.

### Step 2
Oh, to recommend your questions to the most suitable persons, you need to sign up first. Click "Sign up here." and fill in the information.

### Step 3
Well done! Now let's write down some details so that crowds can provide the most well-fit recommendations for you.

### Step 4
You made it! Now people will create nice coursework suited for you. Oh-oh, wait. Would you become an angle for other computer science students, too?

You can answer, or vote, to other people's questions by either clicking them from the main page or searching them. Let's click the first question this time.

### Step 5
Oh, that student needs your help. You can recommend courses by drag-and-drop from the list below. Every time you favored your beneficiary, you get some reputation points.

### Step 6
In case if you don't know what CS473 (and other courses) is, you can see the full name of that course when you hover it.

You can undo recommendations by clicking the recommended course again and choosing "undo."

Wa..ait. An ambitious person recommended a machine learning course to the first semester of a freshman. You can click the course (that you didn't recommend) to cast a downvote, or "Not sure."

### Step 7
Let's get back to your question. Crowds made recommendations for you! Now, all you have to do is to "select" what you will actually take from the list of recommendations.

This makes you get a finished coursework table, as well as help other people who searched yours get meaningful information, too. (Those who voted to get a bonus reputation if you select some of the courses, too!)
