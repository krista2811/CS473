# Milestone 3: Low-fi prototype
> Team Name: Random

> Member: Yujin Chung, Sangho Kim, Jaeryoung Ka

### 1. Problem statement
From our survey, many CS students want to get information on personal coursework, but we also found that asking, getting and sharing diverse experience (or opinion) is hard.

### 2. Tasks
> Users can look up similar cases to their own using a search bar and get meaningful information in a much shorter time.
> **-> Search**

> People can ask a question, searching for the customized coursework table 
> **-> Upload a Question**

> People can give an instant and easy answer to person who need help on choosing coursework, and interact with other users  
> **-> Recommend, Vote**

### 3. Prototype

> NOTE: Invision do not support IE. Please use Chrome to access it.

> We decided to use Invision after inspecting all the three recommendations. The following are some reasons:
* Invision can assign events to buttons. However, in Marvel, designers select a space rather than a button to assign events. Considering that interactions on our prototype are button-focused, we chose Invision.
* Two members had prior experience in Invision, whereas only one person had one on Marvel. From choosing the former, we expected that we could reduce the trial-and-errors from the learnability issues.
* Proto.io only supports a 30-day trial for free and requires payment after that. Our term project lasts longer than a month, and we should refer to the prototype within the project period. That’s why we excluded it.
* As our project name suggests, we wanted to emphasize a drag as a means of interactions. However, all three free-prototyping tools did not support dragging.

> Invision had following pros and cons.
* Animated responses could be made easily. This helped us to make it user-friendly.
* We expect that mobile users would have trouble using the service if we don’t prepare a mobile version. Invision supported both PC and mobile prototypes, as well as one for other devices.
* Invision did not work on IE10 and IE11. So we did user tests in Chrome.

> We chose not to implement the following things:
* Reputation system and algorithms. Because it is hard to test and get meaningful responses. We also could have shown some descriptions like “You get +5 for each confirmed suggestions, -2 for each downvote you got….” However, it’s too descriptive, so we decided not to include it.
* Detailed categories to which each question belong, especially in searching. Regarding coursework Q&A, we have a lot of criteria to categorize a single question. It is a must-do work to get well-fit answers, but tedious and have nothing to test in the stage of the low-fi prototype. So, we decided to skip the stage of checking it, and showed the result page then asked opinions.
* Drags. We initially pondered much whether we should support dragging in the low-fi prototype. Since Invision didn’t support dragging, we chose to give a similar experience to it and not to fully implement drags itself. 
* We used hard-coded data instead of the user’s own data. It is because most prototype tools do not support actions as text-writing, only changing Html pages are available.
